excerpt: 'New Lines: Critical GIS and the Trouble of the Map reinvigorates some of the discussions that GIScience scholars have 
debated for decades by presenting material that is sub-
stantial without being impenetrable. 
I would recommend 
this book to anyone studying GIScience, and especially 
to those interested in GIS and Society, though Wilson’s 
discussions  are  also  relevant  to  the  GIS  community  at  
large. 
It may also appeal to those interested in the digital 
humanities, particularly humanities GIS. This book challenges everyone who usually deals primarily with the technical issues of GIS to more carefully consider the impacts 
of these technologies on society; I know it challenged me.'

## Abstract

New Lines: Critical GIS and the Trouble of the Map reinvigorates some of the discussions that GIScience scholars have 
debated for decades by presenting material that is sub-
stantial without being impenetrable. 
I would recommend 
this book to anyone studying GIScience, and especially 
to those interested in GIS and Society, though Wilson’s 
discussions  are  also  relevant  to  the  GIS  community  at  
large. 
It may also appeal to those interested in the digital 
humanities, particularly humanities GIS. This book challenges everyone who usually deals primarily with the technical issues of GIS to more carefully consider the impacts 
of these technologies on society; I know it challenged me.
