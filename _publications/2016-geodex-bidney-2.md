## Abstract

In the early years of library automation many libraries were innovative in their approach to bringing new technologies to use for library search.
Some of those technologies have long ago been archived or in some cases lost.
Specialized libraries such as map libraries, 
who were early adopters of new technologies are now finding themselves left with legacy systems that are close to or past their life cycle and we are faced with the decision to either phase the system out of service and archive it, 
or to look for ways of breathing new life into these systems. 
The American Geographical Society Library was faced with such a decision recently.
In 1988, the American Geographical Society launched GEODEX: GEOgraphic InDEX System for Map Series.
GEODEX was an innovative means for indexing the hundreds of map series held in the collection at the AGSL.
At the time of its launch, GEODEX was one of the largest automated cartobibliographies in the world close to 400,000 entries.
Changing technology and computer upgrades threatened all of the data held in GEODEX due to operating system incompatibility with the DOS program that was the heart of running GEODEX.
That would have meant over 25 years of work and hundreds of thousands of database records would be rendered useless unless there was a way to bring GEODEX into the 21st century.
After more than a year of development the conversion of GEODEX is just about complete.
A new interface for adding new maps and searching the database bring a fresh look to this impressive database of map series, 
now including online accessibility for the world.
