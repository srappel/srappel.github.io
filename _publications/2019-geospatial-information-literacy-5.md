## Abstract

As librarians are developing library instruction curricula for map and geography libraries, there are many places where one can find guidance.
Instructional frameworks can help organize and teach key competencies and develop literacy of geospatial information for learners.
The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education has become the quintessential guiding document for information literacy instruction in academic libraries.
One does not teach the framework directly, rather the instructor (librarian) identifies threshold concepts, knowledge practices, and dispositions guided by six core concepts and disciplinary context.
Librarians in special collections must consider how to apply such frameworks to specific disciplines, collections, institutions, and curricula.
This paper focuses on geospatial information literacy instruction, best represented by librarians offering instruction services on geospatial data and/or technologies to classes ranging from GIScience courses to humanities classes incorporating digital scholarship.
The unique blend of geographic literacy incorporating geography, primary-source, map, and spatial literacies as well as data and digital literacies, including data information literacy and the emerging Cyber GIScience literacy
make GIScience a discipline where map and geography librarians are well positioned to impact the success of learners and advance pedagogy development.
