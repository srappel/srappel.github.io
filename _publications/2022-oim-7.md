Librarians in the GeoBlacklight community have been collaboratively developing a
digital geographic index map standard. OpenIndexMaps (openindexmaps.org) is an interoperable standard, using the GeoJSON format, for creating and sharing geographic index information for map series and other collections. OpenIndexMaps is catalyzed by the adoption of
Geographic Information Systems in libraries and map collections. The Geodex system, cartobibliography software developed in the 1980s at the American Geographical Society Library at
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, did not reach a critical level of adoption and long-term support, but set the groundwork for creating and sharing index information among map
collections. OpenIndexMaps has the potential to bring about the original aim of the Geodex
projectâ€”to create a union catalog of large paper map series and other collections held across
various institutions. Ultimately, OpenIndexMaps will advance collection management of paper
map series and air photo collections, enhance discoverability of geographic collections, and
improve cooperation between institutions.
