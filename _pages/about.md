About Stephen
======

Stephen Appel lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and is a GIS Librarian, hiker, coder, gamer, and gardner. I have (and express) strong opinions on food, equity, maps, and nature. I'm a Wisconsinsite born and raised.

This is my personal website--thoughts and opinions expressed are strictly my own and not my employer's.

My Job
======

Stephen is the Geospatial Information Specialist at the [American Geographical Society Library](https://www.uwm.edu/libraries/agsl)
--a map and geography special collection at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries](https://www.uwm.edu/).

Somewhere at the intersection of Geographic Information Science, Information Literacy, and Digital Humanities, you will find Stephen using GIS, Geography, and spatial data to answer questions, help people, and understand our world.
