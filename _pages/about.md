About Me
======

Somewhere at the intersection of Geographic Information Science, Information Science, Digital Humanities, and higher education, you will find me using GIS, Geography, and spatial data to answer questions, help people, and understand our world. Having learned geographic information systems as a tool to do research and analyze data in the environmental sciences, working in academic librarianship has broadened my interests to GIS applications in the Humanities and throughout digital scholarship. 

At the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Libraries, my role of Geographic Information Specialist has included curating a collection of geospatial data, teaching information literacy skills through library instruction, using geographic information systems for discovery and access to collections digital and traditional, mentoring learners, contributing to research, and contributing original work to the field.
