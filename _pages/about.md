Stephen Appel lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and is a GIS Librarian, hiker, coder, gamer, and gardner. I have (and express) strong opinions on food, equity, maps, and nature. I'm a Wisconsinsite--born and raised.

This is my personal website--thoughts and opinions expressed are strictly my own and not my employer's.

My Job

Stephen is the Geospatial Information Specialist at the [American Geographical Society Library](https://www.uwm.edu/libraries/agsl)
